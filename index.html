                            The mighty chunks rise all over the world, including the oceans. They usually have steep,
                            sloping sides and sharp or
                            rounded ridges, and a high point, called a peak or summit. Most geologists classify a
                            mountain as a landform that rises
                            at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) or more above its surrounding area. A mountain range is a
                            series or chain of mountains
                            that are close together.

                        <h3>How Are Mountains Formed?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The world's tallest mountain ranges form when pieces of Earth's crust—called plates—smash
                            against each other in a
                            process called plate tectonics, and buckle up like the hood of a car in a head-on collision.
                            The Himalaya in Asia formed
                            from one such massive wreck that started about 55 million years ago. Thirty of the world’s
                            highest mountains are in the
                            Himalaya. The summit of Mount Everest, at 29,035 feet (8,850 meters), is the highest point
                            on Earth.
                            The tallest mountain measured from top to bottom is Mauna Kea, an inactive volcano on the
                            island of Hawaii in the
                            Pacific Ocean. Measured from the base, Mauna Kea stands 33,474 feet (10,203 meters) tall,
                            though it only rises 13,796
                            feet (4,205 meters) above the sea.
                            Volcanic mountains form when molten rock from deep inside the Earth erupts through the crust
                            and piles up on itself. The
                            islands of Hawaii were formed by undersea volcanoes, and the islands seen above water today
                            are the remaining volcano
                            tops. Well-known volcanoes on land include Mount St. Helens in Washington State and Mount
                            Fuji in Japan. Sometimes
                            volcanic eruptions break down mountains instead of building them up, like the 1980 eruption
                            that blew the top off Mount
                            St. Helens.
                            When magma pushes the crust up but hardens before erupting onto the surface, it forms
                            so-called dome mountains. Wind and
                            rain pummel the domes, sculpting peaks and valleys. Examples include the Black Hills of
                            South Dakota and the Adirondack
                            Mountains of New York. Plateau mountains are similar to dome mountains, but form as
                            colliding tectonic plates push up
                            the land without folding or faulting. They are then shaped by weathering and erosion.
                            Other types of mountains form when stresses within and between the tectonic plates lead to
                            cracking and faulting of the
                            Earth's surface, which forces blocks of rock up and down. Examples of fault-block mountains
                            include the Sierra Nevada in
                            California and Nevada, the Tetons in Wyoming, and the Harz Mountains in Germany.

                        <h3>Impact of Mountains on Habitats and Geopolitics.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mountains often serve as geographic features that define natural borders of countries. Their
                            height can influence
                            weather patterns, stalling storms that roll off the oceans and squeezing water from the
                            clouds. The other side is often
                            much drier. The rugged landscapes even provide refuge—and protection—for fleeing and
                            invading armies.
